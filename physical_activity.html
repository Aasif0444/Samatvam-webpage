                    <h2>Swimming or water play</h2>
                    <p>Some children with sensory processing issues love the water. You could enrol your child in swimming lessons, group aquatic therapy, or simply enjoy splashing around together in your local pool. Research has shown that aquatic therapy can improve motor skills and functional performance in children with ASDvii. Just be sure to follow water safety precautions and never leave your child around water unsupervised.

                    <h2>Martial arts</h2>
                    <p>Martial arts focus on developing skills like body awareness, strength, agility and balance. Classes are also typically graded, allowing children and adults to progress as they attain new levels of skill.
                        Research indicates that martial arts-based interventions can have positive effects on symptoms and function in children and youth with ASD, including improved social interaction, communication skills, self-regulation, memory, postural control, and cognitive function</p>

                    <h2>Ball throwing</h2>
                    <p>The ability to throw a ball is important for many sports, including popular ones like netball and rugby. Throwing practice can improve balance and coordination, while throwing a weighted ball (medicine ball) can also improve strength.

                        You could practice throwing a ball with your child, or have them throw it against a wall, at the ground, or at a target (such as into a hoop).</p>

                <h2>Dance</h2>
                <p>Dance is a great way to facilitate movement, get the heart pumping, build muscle strength, and boost skills in coordination and balance. You might like to encourage your child to dance along with their favourite music at home or join a class suited to their abilities and preferences.</p>
