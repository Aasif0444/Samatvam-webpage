            <h1>WHAT IS CONSENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ?
            </h1>
            <p>Overview of consent to treatment. Healthcare professionals may suggest certain kinds of treatments for
                your mental health problem. But in most situations, they can't lawfully treat you unless you agree to
                that treatment.

            <h1>TALKING TO KIDS ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESSES AND AUTISM

            </h1>
            <p>Kids are naturally curious and have questions about mental illness. Understanding mental illness can be
                challenging for adults as well as for children. Myths, confusion, and misinformation about mental
                illnesses can cause anxiety, strengthen stereotypes, and lead to stigma. During the past several
                decades, great advances have been made in the areas of diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses.
                Parents can help children understand that these are real illnesses that can be treated.

            <h1>PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN

            </h1>
            <p>OYoung children need less information and fewer details because of their more limited ability to
                understand. Preschool children focus primarily on things they can see. For example, they may have
                questions about a person who has an unusual physical appearance or who is behaving strangely. They would
                also be very aware of people who are crying and obviously upset, or who are yelling and angry.

            <h1>SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN

            </h1>
            <p>Older children may want more specifics. They may ask more questions, especially about friends or family
                with emotional or behavioral problems. Their concerns and questions are usually very straightforward
                such as: "Why is that person crying? Why does Daddy drink and get so mad? Why is that person talking to
                herself?" They may worry about their safety or the safety of their family and friends. It is important
                to answer their questions directly and honestly and to reassure them about their concerns and feelings.

            <h1>TEENAGERS</h1>
            <p>Teenagers are generally capable of handling much more information and asking more specific and difficult questions. Teenagers often talk more openly with their friends and peers than with their parents. As a result, some teens may already have misinformation about mental illnesses. Teenagers respond more positively to an open dialogue which includes give and take. They are not as open or responsive when a conversation feels one-sided and like a lecture.

            <h1>ABOUT AUTISM</h1>
            <p>Autism is a general term used to describe a group of complex developmental brain disorders
                known as Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD). The other pervasive developmental
                disorders are PDD-NOS (Pervasive Developmental Disorder – Not Otherwise Specified),
                Asperger Syndrome, Rett Syndrome and Childhood
                Disintegrative Disorder. Many parents and professionals
                refer to this group as Autism Spectrum Disorders.
                People with autism have symptoms or difficulty in three
                areas:
                </p>
                <h3>1.⁠ ⁠Social interaction
                </h3>
                <h3>2.⁠ ⁠Language as used for social communication
                </h3>
                <h3>3.⁠ ⁠Repetitive interests or behaviors

            <h1>How common is Autism?
            </h1>
            <p>Today, it is estimated that one in every 110 children is
                diagnosed with autism, making it more common than
                childhood cancer, juvenile diabetes and pediatric AIDS
                combined. An estimated 1.5 million individuals in the U.S.
                and tens of millions worldwide are affected by autism.
                Government statistics suggest the prevalence rate of
                autism is increasing 10-17 percent annually. There is not
                established explanation for this increase, although improved diagnosis and environmental
                influences are two reasons often considered. Studies suggest boys are more likely than girls to
                develop autism and receive the diagnosis three to four times more frequently. Current
                estimates are that in the United States alone, one out of 70 boys is diagnosed with autism.

            <h1>WHAT CAUSES AUTISM?

            </h1>
            <p>The simple answer is we don't know. The vast majority of cases of autism are idiopathic, which
                means the cause is unknown.
                The more complex answer is that just as there are different levels of severity and combinations
                of symptoms in autism, there are probably multiple causes. The best scientific evidence
                available to us today points toward a potential for various combinations of factors causing
                autism – multiple genetic components that may cause autism on their own or possibly when combined with exposure to as yet undetermined environmental factors. Timing of exposure
                during the child's development (before, during, or after birth) may also play a role in the
                development or final presentation of the disorder.
